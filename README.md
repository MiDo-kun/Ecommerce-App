**Note**: Note: The codebase has been refactored and enhanced to ensure a functional version of the repository. Key improvements include optimizing user interface responsiveness, utilizing local storage for JWT token storage, and reconfiguring relationships between Admin, User, Shop Owner, etc.## Main Objective/s

## The main objectives of this project were to:

1. Understand and refactor the existing codebase, encompassing concepts like RESTful APIs, JWT Authentication, Web Sockets, and state management with Redux.
2. Develop a mind map to facilitate efficient navigation and comprehension of the application.
3. Submit a pull request to the original repository, presenting significant improvements to the codebase.

## Key Features

- User and Admin Authentication: Users and administrators can securely authenticate themselves.
- Wishlist and Cart Functionality: Users can add items to their wishlist and cart for easy tracking and purchasing.
- User and Admin Profiles: Users and administrators have dedicated profiles with personalized information.
- Browse Products: Users can explore a wide range of products available on the platform.
- Payment Page using Stripe: Secure and seamless payment processing via the Stripe payment gateway.
- Online Messaging with Web Sockets: Real-time messaging functionality enabled through Web Sockets.
- Stateless Authentication using JWT: Implementation of stateless authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- REST API Implementation with Express.js: Utilization of Express.js for implementing a RESTful API.
- Image Upload with Cloudinary: Integration of Cloudinary for smooth image uploading.
- State Management with Redux Toolkit: Effective state management accomplished using Redux Toolkit.

## What I've Learned

Through this project, I gained the following knowledge and skills:
- Proficiency in Redux state management.
- Secure password hashing (salting).
- Image uploading to Cloudinary.
- Role assignment for specific individuals within the application.
- Integration of the Stripe payment gateway.
- Sending emails via SMTP.
- Displaying app notification status using React Lottie.
- Building a comprehensive mind map to enhance accessibility and information retrieval.
